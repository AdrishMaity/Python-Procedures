Exercise 3. Suppose a, b, c, and d are real numbers, with 0 < a, b, c, d ≤ 50. Alice computes the product of these four numbers, exactly. Bob first rounds each of the numbers to the nearest whole number, then computes their product. Show how differentials can be used to estimate the maximum difference between Alice’s and Bob’s results.
